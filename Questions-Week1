foreignkeyfield
	what exactly is the benefit?
		which allows you to represent foreign-key
		relationships between models in an intuitive way:
		(What does this mean??)

The if username is not in session part does not work for me, is there something wrong?
		@app.route('/incomplete', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
		def incomplete_tasks():
		    if 'username' not in session:
		        return redirect(url_for('login'))

		    if request.method == 'POST':
		        user = User.select().where(User.name == session['username']).get()

		        Task.update(performed=datetime.now(), performed_by=user)\
		            .where(Task.id == request.form['task_id'])\
		            .execute()

		    return render_template('incomplete.jinja2', tasks=Task.select().where(Task.performed.is_null()))
